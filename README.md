Noise Robust Speech Activity Detector

12/16/2015: start with test on buckeye file, plot the feature
12/17/2015: 
    1. reliable islands detection finished, slightly beteter than ROC
    2. refining start and end points finished, however not helping
01/05/2015:
    1. add a training algorithm to find optimal value of A, not working
    2. plot the curve of A and (tpr - tfr) to find the optimal value of A
